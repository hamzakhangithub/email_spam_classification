# email_spam_classification
Created an Email Spam Classification model using ML and NLP concepts. 
The dataset has a column of email text and the other column contains the output that is spam or ham.
spam means it is a spam email else it is ham. The steps were Text Cleaning then converting words to vectors using Count Vectorizer 
and then creating the final model on which multiple ML algorithms were applied and the each algorithm's accuracy score was checked.
